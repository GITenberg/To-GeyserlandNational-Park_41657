<p>Where in confusion canyons and mountains
and swift running rivers with
painted banks abound, and elk and
deer, buffalo and bear range through
the wilds unterrified by man and gun,
and tall, straight pines in almost unbroken forests
plant their feet in a tangle of down-timber that
centuries were required to produce; where in the
earth there are vents through which roar and rush
at exact intervals columns of boiling water, sometimes
more than two hundred feet high, or in which
painted mud blubbers and spurts; where pools by
thousands at scalding heat boil and murmur; where
under one's feet is felt the hollow of the earth and
through hundreds of holes of unfathomable depth
come deep growls of Nature in her confinement;
where dyes have been daubed in delirium on hillsides
and river's brink; where a canyon gashes the
earth thousands of feet through colors so vivid and
varied that no record can write them down; where
one of the highest navigable lakes in the world
washes the feet of mountains that hold aloft the
snows through every month of the year; where the
supernal and the infernal are blended in a harmony
that only Infinitude can produce, and every miracle
of Creation has been worked; where one can be
lost in a wilderness as long as he will and come
face to face with almost every form of creative
eccentricity&#8212;there is <i>Geyserland</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Way_in_and_Out" id="The_Way_in_and_Out"><i>The Way in and Out</i></a></h2>

<p>Yellowstone
National Park
is reached via the
Union Pacific
and its connection,
the Oregon
Short Line, the
New and Direct Route, over
one stem from Kansas City and
Leavenworth, and over another
from Council Bluffs and Omaha.
By way of the latter you cross
the Missouri River over a
magnificent steel bridge and
traverse the "Lane Cut Off," a
splendid illustration of modern
railroad construction. If you
journey over the stem from
Kansas City, your way leads
through a succession of thriving
cities and towns amid the finest
farming region of the West, and
through beautiful Denver,
through Cheyenne, thence
through Wyoming, and a portion
of Utah, to Ogden, from which
point Salt Lake City, 37 miles
distant, is reached.</p>

</div>

<p>Leaving the central system of
transcontinental lines, access to
the Park is had in a night by
way of the Oregon Short Line
Railroad from Salt Lake City,
Ogden, or Pocatello to the
station, Yellowstone, Montana,
at the western border, nineteen
miles from the Fountain Hotel.</p>

<p>All along this route are strewn
stretches of delightful scenery,
and fields of rare fertility; but
these things the tourist does
not see&#8212;he awakens for breakfast
at Yellowstone, and an
hour thereafter is following the
course of the beautiful Madison,
well on his way into the Park
and to the wonders that there
await him.</p>

<p>As a whole, the
scenery of the
Park is restful
and satisfying.
What it lacks
in the stupendous
it makes
up in softness of coloring and
the gentle undulations that
lead gradually to the massive
mountains. The green of the
pines, lightened and darkened
here and there with the shades
of different species, is everywhere.
The waters of the
rivers are dimmed by the shadows;
the cascades have a
glimmer and sparkle quite their
own, and now and then peep
out in the sweeps of the distance,
little lakes that shimmer in the
sun. Vagrant clouds of steam,
signs of the geysers and boiling
springs, are seen all over the
landscape, especially in the
early morning when a little of
the night frost still lingers in the
air. Many grotesque shapes are
taken on by the rocks, and there
is hardly a spring or pool that
does not suggest its name by its
form. From the Lake Hotel
can be seen facing skyward, the
profile of a human face so perfect
it has long been called
"The Sleeping Giant." Yellowstone
Lake is a marvel of beauty;
the dense forest comes down to
its shores, little dots of islands
sprinkle its surface, its waters are
crystal clear away into the deep,
and under the kiss of the sun the
face of the sea takes on a glory
altogether splendid.</p>

<h2><a name="Coaching_in_the_Park" id="Coaching_in_the_Park"><i>Coaching in the Park</i></a></h2>

<p>The stage coach,
the old-fashioned
one with
the lofty seat for
the driver and
the boot and the
thorough-brace,
the rocking-cradle vehicle that
served so well when civilization
was beating its way westward
fifty years ago, holds the first
right-of-way through the Park.
Driven from use almost everywhere
else by the iron horse, it
has found safe refuge there, and
neither the railways nor the automobiles
can enter to oppose it.</p>

 <a href="images/img009abhd.jpg">larger</a></p>
</div>

<p>A good half of the pleasures
of the tour is found in the
coaching. To watch for the
coming of the stage at the door
of the Inn where the baggage is
piled, and the porters and bell
boys stand expectant&#8212;to hear
the clatter of the wheels, the
sound of hoofs, and to see the
gaily harnessed horses in conscious
pride swing the coach
gracefully under the Porte
Cochere&#8212;to be wheeled over
the winding, dustless roads at
ten miles an hour behind prancing
leaders and wheelers&#8212;to be
garbed as you please without
thought of style or detail&#8212;to
breathe air distilled among the
fragrant pines&#8212;to be touched
by breezes that fan your cheek
and dishevel your hair&#8212;to be
free from all care and abandon
yourself to the delights that come
with the everchanging scenes
that panoramic Nature is constantly
unfolding to your gaze&#8212;is
to experience an exhilaration
never to be found among the
busy haunts of men.</p>

<p>The drivers, gentlemanly and
skillful, are full of information,
and you do the 158 miles from
Yellowstone around the circle
back to Yellowstone with so
little fatigue that you regret the
trip is not longer.</p>

<p>Two companies
of United
States Cavalry
are stationed
at Fort Yellowstone,
and, during
the summer
detachments of these troops are
placed in different parts of the
reservation. Their duties are to
patrol the Park, prevent the
spreading of forest fires and the
commission of acts of vandalism.
The troops have authority to
make arrests for any violation of
Park regulations. Hunting is
especially prohibited, and all
guns are officially sealed at the
entrance to the Park.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Geysers" id="The_Geysers"><i>The Geysers</i></a></h2>

<p>Nature has lavished her gifts on the region of the Yellowstone&#8212;wild woodland, crystal
rivers, gorgeous canyons and sparkling cascades&#8212;all under the guard of mountain sentinels
around whose lofty heads group every form of cloud castle that vagrant winds can build.
But of all the wonders that God in His mysterious way has there worked to perform, none
is so strange&#8212;so startling&#8212;as the geysers.</p>

<p>To count them, great and small, would be like counting the stars, and to measure in
words their awful power, or picture their splendor of sparkle and symmetry&#8212;that, no one
can do. They must be seen to be appreciated, and once seen&#8212;the memory and mystery of them will
linger to the end of the longest life. They are as different as geysers can be. There are dead geysers&#8212;dead
from bursted throats&#8212;mere boiling pools now&#8212;shaped to resemble a variety of familiar things;
with depths that the eye cannot sound, and colors&#8212;blues, greens, purples, reds&#8212;down their deep sides
and in the wonderful tracery about their rims, so blended, so beautiful that one may well believe that all
the paints on the palette of the Master were commingled in their decoration.</p>

<p>One blubbers and gurgles and grumbles awhile, and then with an angry roar lifts a great column of
mud into the air. Another steams and growls through an orifice hundreds of feet wide in seeming angry
spite that years ago it blew out its throat and ceased to gush forever.
<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
But the geysers that most attract
are the regular-timed spouting wonders&#8212;the Giant and Giantess, Old Faithful, the Grand, the Fountain,
the Castle and others whose names mark the geography of the Park.</p>

 In 1888, Excelsior, then the greatest geyser in the known world, while playing with unusual vigor, ruptured its crater and
 has never spouted since. In its former periods of activity it is said to have raised the Firehole river seven feet in as many minutes
 with its waters. (<i>Ed.</i>)</p>

 <a href="images/img014hd.jpg">larger</a></p>
</div>

<p class="cb2"><i>The Geysers</i></p>

<p>They are variously located in three distinct basins which are far enough apart to give the traveler by
stage a few geysers with each day's entertainment. These basins are great wastes of a white deposition
called in Park vernacular "the formation" under which must be boiling one of the mighty cauldrons of the
earth, for one can feel under foot a tremble, and can hear through a hundred orifices the hiss of steam and
the angry murmur of the waters below.</p>

<p>The coming and going of the geysers is an astonishing and awe-inspiring spectacle, and so accurately
timed and so certain to perform are they, that no one need miss the experience. The geyser passive is a
hole at the summit of a cone. The cone rises gradually from the plane of the formation and, ragged and
deep, growls hoarsely and steams fitfully. Thus it is a moment before its time for activity, and then comes
the geyser active. There is a loud preliminary roar and then suddenly, with a rush and power almost
terrifying, a white obelisk of scalding, steaming water is lifted into the air sometimes 250 feet, and there
held scintillating and glistening in the sun until the play is over, when it sinks gradually back from whence
it came, and the fitful growling and steaming begins anew.</p>

<p>Every geyser has a time of its own and there are thousands of them, varying in size from the little
growler that sputters and spits a thimbleful from its tiny throat, to the Giant that three times a month plays
for ninety minutes, 250 feet high.</p>

<p>How old the geysers are, recorded time does not tell, but one or two of the wise men, who are always
measuring the duration of things by some system of calculation, have determined by multiplying the
deposition from each eruption by the height of the cone, that the Giant, for instance, has been playing
some thousands of years.</p>

<p>If those who come and go across the land every year on pleasure bent only knew how curious and
beautiful geysers are, the National Park would count its visitors by multitudes.</p>

<h2><a name="Old_Faithful" id="Old_Faithful"><i>Old Faithful</i></a></h2>

<p>In imagination, lift in a symmetrical cone two hundred and fifty thousand gallons of scalding,
steaming water one hundred and fifty feet high and hold it there three minutes; jewel the
grand fountain with a million diamonds; filter through it the hues of innumerable dancing
rainbows; commingle in confusion every sound of splash and splutter&#8212;and you will have
a faint idea of Old Faithful in action.</p>

<p>It is the immutable water-clock of the Yellowstone&#8212;the most perfect illustration of
geyseric phenomena&#8212;the most famous and beautiful geyser in the whole world.</p>

<p>The note of the beginning of the play of the geyser is an angry growl down deep in its throat whence
almost instantly the water, in rapid recurrent leaps, forms the stately fountain that plays for three minutes and
then slowly sinks into the earth to await its time to rise again. Sometimes the winds unfold from its top an
iridescent banner of spray; but more often the fountain form is a perfect cone.</p>

<p>Old Faithful plays every seventy minutes and never disappoints. Visitors to the Park may therefore see
it under various conditions of light. In the daytime, under the sun, it glistens and gleams with prismatic hues;
but the most enchanting hour to witness its performance is that when night is falling&#8212;when the dusk is
around it, and the last faint tints of the sun linger in the sky. Then it is a spectre in ghostly white standing
against the sombre background of the wilderness&#8212;a sight strange and startling and never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>It has long been the custom at Old Faithful Inn to flood the geyser at night with the rays of a searchlight.
Then the spectacle takes on new features&#8212;all the rainbow hues are there, and looking through the fountain
along the sweep of light, one sees a bediamonded form more beautiful than any ever wrought by the hands
of the Ice King.</p>

<p>Verily, Old Faithful is one of the most wonderful presentations in all
the repertoire of Nature.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Canyon_and_Falls_of_the_Yellowstone" id="The_Canyon_and_Falls_of_the_Yellowstone"><i>The Canyon and Falls of the Yellowstone</i></a></h2>

<p>The Canyon and Falls of the Yellowstone beggar description. They are twin wonders in a
Wonderland. Is there any other gorge as gorgeous as that Canyon? With such gaiety of
coloring&#8212;with such delicate and lovely shades of yellows and reds, purples and pinks, greens
and crimsons, all commingling in harmony from the green-fringed brink, down, down the
craggy sides into sombre depths where the writhing, gleaming ribbon of river thousands
of feet below, plunges along on its winding way to the sea?</p>

<p>And the falls&#8212;the drapery of the canyon&#8212;the two silvery curtains that hang at its head&#8212;a
great river pouring over a precipice and falling in glassy sheets hundreds of feet, then ruffling and flouncing
and festooning until lost into the rainbow-hued mist at their feet.</p>

<p>See all this as thousands have and thousands will from "Inspiration Point"&#8212;a rocky balcony over the
gorge, with the eagle's nests below you&#8212;or from "Artist's Point" on the other side, where Moran transferred
the glories of canyon and falls to canvas; or see it from any of the other places where tourists love to linger
and look, and you will see the most tremendous, stupendous, alluring and altogether splendid spectacle that
Nature ever spread out for the wonder, amazement and delight of mortal eyes.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Mammoth_Hot_Springs" id="The_Mammoth_Hot_Springs"><i>The Mammoth Hot Springs</i></a></h2>

<p>The structural features are the Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel and the garrison of Fort Yellowstone,
around which, and in the vicinity of the springs, the landscape gardener has produced
many beautiful effects. Here are found the most remarkable terrace-building hot springs
in the world. The formation is calcareous, and the deposition by the waters has built up
through the centuries cataracts in stone of indescribable beauty through which the paints
from the earth have been mingled and blended with a vividness of coloring and a perfection
of shading that none but the Master's hand could work.</p>

<p>The waters are of such extraordinary transparency that the eye can only guess at their depth. They
are held steaming and pulsating in great over-hanging bowls, from which they gently flow down over the
stony cataracts, carving and decorating as they go. Jupiter and Pulpit Terraces are the master-pieces of
Nature here; but there are hundreds of other curious and beautiful things to see. The drive to and from
Norris is alive with interest. It leads through the Golden Gate, and on the way can be seen Obsidian Cliff,
Roaring Mountain, Beaver and Twin Lakes and other attractive and curious features of topography.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Tame_Wild_Animals" id="The_Tame_Wild_Animals"><i>The Tame Wild Animals</i></a></h2>

<p>The animals of the Park are objects of peculiar interest. No sound of gun or bark of dog is
ever heard, and the animals, though wild, have become so tame that they give only curious
notice to tourists as they pass. Deer, elk and bear roam at will throughout Geyserland.
The red squirrel and the chipmunk scamper along the roadway, and those furry little
bundles, the wood-chucks, flatten out on the rocks and take no heed of your passing. It
is an everyday sight to see deer and their young by the roadside, and now and then you
get a glimpse of an antlered elk, with his family of cows, swimming the streams of the
Park. So much has been accomplished by law in robbing man of his terrors to the wild, that all of
the animals in the Park, except those that&#8212;like the mountain lion and sheep, frequent places inaccessible
to travelers&#8212;have well-nigh lost their fears.</p>

<p>The bears, some of them wrapped in robes that would command a fancy price, come down in the
evening from their homes in the hills to feed around the hotels. The after-dinner entertainment they afford
to guests is an everyday pleasure.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Inns" id="The_Inns"><i>The Inns</i></a></h2>

<p>They happen along at the end of each day's drive&#8212;great roomy structures alive with light
and full of comfort and good cheer. And such inns they are&#8212;generous lobbies to lounge
in before old-fashioned fire-places, with their blazing, snapping logs&#8212;beds to sleep in, clean
and restful&#8212;prettily furnished rooms&#8212;and cookery and service almost too good to be true.
To find all these things in a far-away wilderness is to wonder what magic was worked to
bring them all about.</p>

<p>The great inn at Mammoth has in its foreground, three hundred feet high, the wonderful,
many-colored, and beautifully-formed Hot Springs Terraces which belong in the list of the water-made
wonders of the Park.</p>

<p>One of the inns&#8212;Old Faithful&#8212;cannot be matched anywhere in the world. It is a lofty, wide-spreading
structure of logs, with a touch of Swiss about its gables and windows. Within, the logs are everywhere&#8212;partitions,
balustrades, stair-steps, and newel posts&#8212;even the drinking fountain is a log. It must
have been a mighty task to search the forests for all the queer forms of growth that enter into the construction
of the curious, rustic interior. And the lobby, with its four great cheerful fireplaces&#8212;its huge corn popper&#8212;its
clock and twenty-foot pendulum, and all the log-made galleries above it&#8212;that charms and comforts
beyond the power of words to tell.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img032.jpg" width="600" height="414" alt="New Grand Canon Hotel" />
<p class="caption">Old Faithful Inn<a href="images/img032hd.jpg">
larger</a></p></div>

<p>The inns are located nearby the greatest marvels of the Park and their sites have been selected to show
them off with admirable skill.</p>

<p>From the Fountain the geysers of the lower basin can be seen at their play.</p>

<p>Old Faithful Inn looks out upon a great steaming, spouting field, and has its namesake&#8212;the glory of all
the geysers&#8212;almost at its doors. So near, indeed, is it, that all the night through, at intervals of seventy
minutes, can be heard the old monster in eruption.</p>

<p>On a slope that sweeps gently down to the waters sits the Lake Inn. The forest creeps down to it on
three sides, and the outlook from its goodly porches is over the broad expanse of Yellowstone Lake&#8212;one
of the highest of navigated seas, and as passive, clear and prettily tree-trimmed a sheet of water as there is
in the world. You may reach this inn from Thumb by steamer or by coach; but if you would have two
hours of ecstacy, take the steamer. Thumb is a lunch station, and the lunch there is a creation.</p>

<p>The Canyon Inn is almost on the brink of the gorge where falls the Yellowstone. It is a duplication
in excellence of the other inns, and when you bid it good-bye it is to begin your last day's tour of the Park.
Then comes Norris, with its geysers and its awful "Black Growler," and a lunch that will send the tourist
on his homeward way with a grateful heart. After that&#8212;Yellowstone&#8212;and the whistle of the engine and
the waiting Pullman&#8212;your tour is ended and the Park a pleasant memory.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent

     gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
